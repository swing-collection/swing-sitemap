### Additional Enhancements and Considerations:

1. **Customize for Each Search Engine:**
   - Different search engines might have specific requirements for sitemap submission. Ensure that you adhere to their guidelines, such as using the correct URL format and handling response codes appropriately.

2. **API Keys and Tokens:**
   - Some search engines (like Baidu in the example) may require authentication in the form of API keys or tokens. Make sure these are securely stored and accessed, preferably through your Django settings.

3. **Rate Limiting and Compliance:**
   - Be mindful of rate limiting and other usage policies imposed by the search engines. Submitting too frequently or improperly can result in your requests being blocked.

4. **Expandable Structure:**
   - The dictionary-based approach allows for easy addition of more search engines in the future. Just add the new engine and its submission URL to the `search_engines` dictionary.

5. **Testing:**
   - Thoroughly test with each search engine to ensure your requests are correctly formatted and successfully received.

6. **Error Reporting and Monitoring:**
   - Consider integrating with an error reporting and monitoring service for better visibility and alerting in case of issues.

Remember, while automating sitemap submissions can be beneficial, it's also important to ensure that the sitemap itself is correctly formatted and up-to-date to be effectively processed by the search engines.
